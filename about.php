				<p>Infact, UI and UX design is really what made me interested in pursuing a career in web development.  Since I was a teenager, every job I have held has required me to learn different interfaces to complete certain tasks.  I was shocked by the amount of poorly designed interfaces I was forced to use.  I was frustrated.  I thought, I could do better.</p>
				<p>My goal with all of my design projects is to create the best UI that I can.  I believe that the best UI is the one that the user never notices.  A user uses an interface to complete a task.  A user interface should be intuitive and get out of the way, letting the user complete their tasks with ease and efficiency.  </p>
				<p>When I'm not designing for the web, I like to spend time with my family, play the drums, complete woodworking and home repair projects and engage with social media.</p>
