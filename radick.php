			<p>J. Radick Roofing, Siding and Windows, a local roofing and siding company, needed an informative website. They wanted the website to have a contact form, give some basic information about the company, and also link with their Facebook page.</p>
			
			<p>I constructed their website mainly in Notepad &#40;until I downloaded and started using Dreamweaver&#41;, using Bootstrap 4 for layout and Jquery for the animations.  This was actually the first website that I developed that went live on the web.</p>
			
			<p>The client was not very particular about the design for this website.  I drew some rough wireframes on paper before getting started but I did not create any in Adobe XD.  Since I was building the website in a sandbox folder on my personal website's server, I simply shared the url with the client and asked for their feedback on certain things as I went.</p>
